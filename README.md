ngsAssociation
==============

ngsAssociation is a program that implements probablistic methods for association mapping using pooled or unpooled next-generation sequencing data. It can be used to calculate a likelihood ratio (LR) for a test of association between a particular allele and phenotype. The program can also be used to estimate allele frequencies and obtain a LR for a test of whether a site is variable.
